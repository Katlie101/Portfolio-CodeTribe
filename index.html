               <h3 id="ED">Educational Background</h3>
   
                 I have completed my high school with an NSC (National Senior Certificate) and pursued to the University of Limpopo to complete
                 a Bachelor's Degree in Physical Sciences - which was completed in the year of 2021 so I currently hold a BSc (Physical Sciences)
                 qualification. During my undergraduate studies apart from only studying I had to also perform an experiment and submit a report 
                  on the experiment performed so with that below is a list of the skills obtained during my undergraduate studies:
                <br>
                <br>
                       
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Written and Oral Communication</b>
               <br>
                Writting tests, exams and reports assisted in the above communication while presentations assisted in the oral communication.
                </li>
                   <br>
                     <br>
        <li> <b>Laboratory Techniques</b>
               Hands on experiments had to be performed also includes being familiar with lab equipments and how they are operated.
                 </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
        <li> <b>Software proficency</b>
               I used microsoft office suite to prepare my reports very familiar with microsoft word 
               for word processing, Excel for the spreadsheet in order to store and analyze large amounts of data and with powerpoint to prepare
               for presentations. I am familiar with the use of visual code to create html documents. 
                  </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
               
               <b>Organizational skills</b>
               <br> 
               I use the calendar or a year planner which assists in managing my time, planning for future occasions in advance
               and to prioritise  the important events first.
            </li>
               <br>
               <br>
        <li>  <b>Adaptability Skills</b>
              
            <br>
               I am a fast learner who adapts quickly to my environment, 
               flexibilty is like second nature to me and I look into new ideas as an opportunity to learn new things in other words 
               I am open-minded to trying out new things.</li>

                       During my first year of honours, the research topic which I focused on was water purification. That was considered my 
                       project for the year in 2023. The aim of the research project was to investigate the properties of aluminium sulphate which 
                       is the commonly used chemical(which is not safe) to clean dirty water and compare it to the materials that are easily reachable, econonmically, environmentally and safe 
                       such as fruit seeds to see whether they would act any similar to the aluminium sulphate. Download the research project document below to read up on the final research project drasubmitted to my supervisors.
