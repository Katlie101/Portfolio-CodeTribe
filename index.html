            University of the Free State. Her interest in understanding the fundamental principles of matter and the laws governing chemical reactions has 
            landed her to the journey of becoming a Chemist. She completed her Bachelor's degree in Physical Sciences from the University of Limpopo in 2021. Katlego commonly known as Kat has 
            a curious mindset and is always willing to learn new things. Apart from academics Kat has worked as virtual assistant, a waitress, an ambassador
            and an assistant cook. She is the founder of Errands By Kat which is a business that deals with assisting people with their daily tasks kind of like a personal assistant
            on call. In her spare time she would read books, take walks or catch up with friends. One of her favorite things to do is cooking. She recently
            discovered coding and is an interest she is willing to upskill. She loves to be organized and always makes sure she does everything to her best ability. In future she would love
            to own her own laboratory because she loves experimenting.
