            <h4>Projects Done</h4>
            <p>During my first year of honours, the research topic which I focused on was water purification. That was considered my 
                project for the year in 2023. The aim of the research project was to investigate the properties of aluminium sulphate which 
                is the commonly used chemical(which is not safe) to clean dirty water and compare it to the materials that are easily reachable, econonmically, environmentally and safe 
                such as fruit seeds to see whether they would act any similar to the aluminium sulphate. Download the document below to read up on the final research project draft submitted to my supervisors.
